The dashboard provides a clear operational view of:
- Supplier performance against purchase orders  
- Pending units and pending USD exposure  
- Delivery efficiency over time  
- Supplier-level operational bottlenecks

## 🎯 Business Purpose
The main objectives of this dashboard are to:
- Track **Purchase Orders (POs)** and their fulfillment status  
- Identify suppliers with **high pending units or USD exposure**  
- Monitor **monthly delivery trends**  
- Support **data-driven decisions** in procurement and supplier management

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI**
- **DAX**
- **Power Query**
- **SAP (data source)**
- **CSV files**

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Supplier delivery concentration risk**: A small number of suppliers account for the majority of **pending units and pending USD**, increasing operational risk if delivery delays occur.
- **Mismatch between physical and financial execution**: The percentage of **USD delivered is lower than the percentage of units delivered**, indicating that higher-value items tend to be delivered later, increasing short-term financial exposure.
- **Uneven delivery performance throughout the year**: Monthly delivery volumes show strong variability, with clear peaks and drops, highlighting opportunities to improve planning accuracy, supplier coordination, and workload leveling.
